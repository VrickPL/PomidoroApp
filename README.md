## Timer logic
The timer updates every second while the app is open. If you close the app or turn off your phone, *don't worry*â€”the timer keeps running in the background. When you reopen the app, **the timer will continue** where it left off. If the countdown finishes while you're away, **you'll receive a notification** and the timer will automatically switch to the next mode. Simply return to the app to resume!
<br>
<br>
If you adjust the time settings while the timer is active, **the timer will reset** to reflect your new preferences.
<br>
<br>
If you stop the timer and close the app, **the app will remember your progress**, so when you return, you'll pick up right where you left off. *Smart, right?*





## Settings
In Settings you can adjust:
- **Work and Break Time**: Select your preferred durations for both work and break intervals.
- **Language**: Choose between English, Polish, or let the app automatically detect your preference.
- **Theme**: Switch between Dark Mode, Light Mode, or set it to Auto to adapt to system settings.
- **Haptics**: Enable or disable phone vibrations.

All your selections will be securely stored in **AppStorage** for convenience.
