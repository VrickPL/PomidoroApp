**Pomidoro** is a modern app, designed to enhance productivity through the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)! Its user-friendly interface makes it ideal for both newcomers and seasoned users looking to optimize their work habits. Customize your work time and break time by setting your own values in the settingsâ€”the app will remember your preferences for future sessions. As you work and rest, you'll be accompanied by charming icons of a growing tomato, adding a touch of motivation to your productivity journey!
